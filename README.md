<b>What is K-Means Clustering</b>

K-means clustering is a classical clustering algorithm that uses an expectation maximization like technique to partition a number of data points into k clusters. 
We are given a data set of items, with certain features, and values for these features (like a vector). The task is to categorize those items into groups. To achieve this, we will use the kMeans algorithm; an unsupervised learning algorithm.
